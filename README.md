## üìù Project Overview
**MambaCoral-DiffDet (MMCD)** is a robust diffusion model and knowledge distillation framework designed for coral detection in complex underwater environments. It enhances coral recognition accuracy and efficiency by incorporating state-of-the-art generative models. The code for **MambaCoral-DiffDet** will be made publicly available once our paper is accepted.

## üìÇ Dataset Information

### Original Dataset
The original dataset used in this project is available at the following link:
- **[SCoralDet Dataset](https://github.com/RDXiaoLu/SCoralDet-Dataset.git)**

This dataset contains images from six coral species: Euphylliaancora, Favosites, Platygyra, Sarcophyton, Sinularia, and Wavinghand, collected from the **Coral Germplasm Conservation and Breeding Center** at **Hainan Tropical Ocean University**.

### Augmented Dataset
Using the **MambaCoral-DiffDet** model's **DGM structure**, we have created an augmented dataset. The dataset now contains **1,204 images**, representing an **86% increase** in image quantity while using only **18% of the original images**. This augmentation helps improve the robustness of coral detection models by providing a more diverse set of training images.

You can download the augmented dataset here:
